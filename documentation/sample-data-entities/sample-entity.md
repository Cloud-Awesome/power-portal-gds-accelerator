# Sample Entity

The intention of this repo is to provide a fully functional GDS portal, including some sample question pages and entity lists, which requires some data.

If you're only after the base framework then you can either delete the sample managed solution (and related data), or simply don't install it and you can delete the sample entity forms and entity lists.

The sample entity contains the following attributes:


| Friendly Name | Schema Name | Data Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Name | awe_name | string |
| ... | ... | whole number |
| ... | ... | optionset |
| ... | ... | lookup |
| ... | ... | datetime |
| ... | ... | date only |
