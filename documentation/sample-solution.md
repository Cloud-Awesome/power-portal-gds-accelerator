# Sample Solution

The intention of this repo is to provide a fully functional GDS portal, including some sample question pages and entity lists, which requires some data.

If you're only after the base framework then you can either delete the sample managed solution (and related data), or simply don't install it and you can delete the sample entity forms and entity lists.

The Sample Solution includes one entity so that the sample data can be uploaded to provide a fully functional sample GDS site.

It also includes my publisher but again, this can all be deleted after import by deleting this managed solution.

See details of the entity included in this solution here: [Sample Entity](sample-data-entities/sample-entity.md)
