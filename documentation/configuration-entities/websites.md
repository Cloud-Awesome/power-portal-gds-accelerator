# Websites

It's best to install this configuration at the start of a new portal project.

To help keep all the records related to the top-level parent site, a single Website record is included in this project. Once imported you can change any of the details such as url and name, etc.

After importing, you can update the Website Binding record to point to this record and delete the one that was created by the portal installation.

Alternatively, if for some reason you need to retain the original Webite record, you can find and replace the GUID for each configuration record in this project.
