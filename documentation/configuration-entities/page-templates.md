| GDS - Entity Form | [GDS Entity Form](web-templates.md#gds-entityform-template) | Page with text, data entry and CTA button(s) defined in an Entity form. Can also include an Entity List for tabular data |
| GDS - Task List | [GDS Task List](web-templates.md#gds-task-list-template) | Renders a summary [Task List](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/task-list-pages/) with links to other web pages|
| GDS - Interruption Card | [GDS Interruption Card](web-templates.md#gds-interruption-card) | An page that interrupts the user flow with important information. This is not an official GDS pattern - see [related research](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/27) |
| GDS - Service Complete | [GDS Service Complete](web-templates.md#gds-service-complete) | Simple page confirming the user has [completed the service/process](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages/) |
| GDS - Step by Step Navigation | TODO | Implements the [Step by step navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/step-by-step-navigation/) pattern. In progress... |
| Check your answers | [Contact details/Check your answers](web-templates.md#contact-detailscheck-your-answers) | I haven't worked out a way to create a generic [Check your answers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/) page yet - each page currently requires a new web template and page template. This is a worked example that can be copied for other service pages |

If other patterns are created or would be of use that haven't been listed above, please get in touch and raise a new [Feature request](https://github.com/Cloud-Awesome/power-portal-gds-accelerator/issues/new/choose)

Other pages and templates are included (e.g. 404, B2C Login) are included but should only be used once for a single page, whereas the others are the basis for all new pages.
